# Covid-19-Database

The COVID19DATABASE SYSTEM” project has been designed keeping in mind the probable distribution of the covid-19 vaccine in India. The database contains entities such as

(1) world 

(2) India 

(3) Vaccine Distribution India 

(4) Age India 

with different types of cardinality and ER Diagram.

The user of the database can get different types of information from this database such as 

(1) Population of State age-wise 

(2) total covid-19 cases state-wise up to date 24/11/2020 

(3) vaccine development stages in different countries 

(4) number of health workers [Doctors] state-wise for analyzing requirements of vaccine distribution. 

The main aim of this project is to build up a database that can help in the planning of covid-19 vaccine distribution in India.

# Installation Requirements:

- Need to install a Microsoft SQL server for working on this project.

**What is SQL Server?**

SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. SQL Server supports ANSI SQL, which is the standard Structured Query Language. However, SQL Server comes with its implementation of the SQL language, T-SQL (Transact-SQL). It is primarily designed and developed to compete with MySQL and Oracle databases.

**Pre-Requisites**

Principally, MS SQL server download for Windows 10 requires:

.Net Framework, 1GB of recommended memory, and NTFS system.

**How to download SQL Server Setup**

Below is a step by step process on how to download SQL in Windows 10:

**Step 1)**  Go to URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-downloads for Microsoft SQL server download

Microsoft provides two specialized free SQL download editions to work on MS SQL server:

**Developer** – It has all feature which MS SQL server offers but we cannot use it in production. From the learning perspective, is it an ideal candidate to start.
**Express:**  This is also a free SQL server download version but with a limited set of features with no business intelligence applications.
We will select the Developer edition MS SQL server download for installation.

**Step 2)**  Click on "Download now"

We will get SQL server installation set up as 'SQLServer2017-SSEI-Dev.exe'.

**Step 4)** Choose the location

Below 'SQL server install location' window will appear.

The Default location is C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server.
Optionally, we can also change the installation location by clicking on Browse.3. Once the location is selected, click the 'Install' button to start SQL installation Windows 10.
